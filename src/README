SocksPy.java : This class is the main class, runs the server and accepts up to 20 connections. Takes care of distributing the accepted connection to threads that run SockHandler class
SockHandler.java: This class does all the processing for the Socks protocol and does the proxying of the data.

Architecture:
The architecture is a combination of Threads and NIO.
Basically every thread does the necessary validation and then joins the channels such that they will write and read to each other asynchronously.
Basic setting opposed selector generates that writing is only available when reading is ready as well.
